## üé¨ Part 1: Business Impact Demo (2 minutes)

### Opening Hook (15 seconds)

> "Marketing teams spend millions on campaigns without knowing which creative elements will resonate. We've built an AI platform that analyzes video creatives, quantitative metrics, and audience feedback to generate **specific, actionable recommendations** in under 5 minutes."

### Live Demo Flow

#### Step 1: Show the Problem (20 seconds)

Navigate to Dashboard:
- "Here's a typical scenario: A brand has pre-tested their Q4 campaign with 1,000+ survey responses."
- "They have quantitative metrics showing the ad underperforms with Gen Z."
- "They have hundreds of open-ended comments."
- **Problem**: "What specifically should they change?"

#### Step 2: Create Experiment (30 seconds)

Click "New Experiment":
1. **Title**: "Q4 Brand Campaign - Gen Z Test"
2. **Upload video**: Select sample `.mp4`
3. **Upload Results CSV**: Select `*_Results.csv`
4. **Upload Comments CSV**: Select `*_Comments.csv`
5. Click "Create Experiment"

> "In 30 seconds, we've uploaded everything. Now let's analyze it."

#### Step 3: Trigger Analysis (10 seconds)

- Click "Start Analysis"
- Show progress indicator
- **While processing**: "Our AI is now analyzing the video with TwelveLabs, processing audio with ElevenLabs, running NLP on 1,000+ comments, and correlating everything with statistical metrics."

#### Step 4: Show Results (45 seconds)

Navigate to completed experiment (use pre-analyzed backup if needed):

**Summary Metrics**:
- "Overall purchase intent: **-8%** (negative impact)"
- "But look at the segmentation..."

**Recommendations**:
- Filter by "age_18_24" segment
- Show top recommendation:
  - **Priority**: High
  - **Type**: Change
  - **Element**: "Voiceover tone in opening scene"
  - **Justification**: "Young adults found the formal tone disconnected. Quantitative data shows -12% purchase intent in this segment. Qualitative feedback repeatedly mentions 'too corporate' and 'not authentic.'"
  - **Evidence**: Show confidence interval, representative quotes

**Key Message**:
> "Instead of vague feedback like 'Gen Z didn't like it,' we're telling them: **Change the voiceover tone in the first 5 seconds to be more conversational**. Backed by data."

#### Step 5: Export (10 seconds)

- Click "Export PDF"
- Show downloaded report
- "This goes straight to the creative director and C-suite."

## üîß Part 2: Technical Deep-Dive (3 minutes)

### Architecture Overview (45 seconds)

Open API docs (http://localhost:8000/docs):

> "Let me show you what's happening under the hood."

**Tech Stack**:
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) - async, high-performance
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript - modern, responsive
- **AI Integration**:
  - TwelveLabs: Video scene detection, object recognition, transcript
  - ElevenLabs: Audio emotion analysis
  - OpenAI GPT-4: Qualitative summarization
  - Transformers: Sentiment analysis, topic modeling

**Data Flow**:
1. Video ‚Üí TwelveLabs ‚Üí Scene breakdown, visual tags, transcript
2. Audio extraction ‚Üí ElevenLabs ‚Üí Emotion, tone, quality
3. Comments CSV ‚Üí NLP pipeline ‚Üí Sentiment, themes, keywords
4. Results CSV ‚Üí Statistical analysis ‚Üí Deltas, confidence intervals
5. **Recommendation Engine**: Correlates all three data sources

### AI Integration Demo (60 seconds)

Show API endpoint: `POST /api/analysis/{id}/analyze`

**TwelveLabs Integration**:
```python
# Upload video to TwelveLabs
video_id = twelvelabs_client.upload_video(video_url)

# Analyze creative elements
analysis = twelvelabs_client.analyze_creative_elements(video_id)
# Returns: visual style, pacing, tone, key moments

# Get scene breakdown
scenes = twelvelabs_client.get_video_segments(video_id)
# Returns: timestamps, descriptions, visual tags
```

**NLP Pipeline**:
```python
# Sentiment analysis
sentiments = nlp_analyzer.analyze_sentiment(comments)
# Returns: positive/negative/neutral distribution

# Extract themes
themes = openai_client.extract_themes_from_comments(comments)
# Returns: top themes with keywords

# Get representative quotes
quotes = nlp_analyzer.get_representative_comments(comments)
```

**Recommendation Generation**:
```python
# Correlate video elements with metrics
for segment in segments:
    metrics = get_segment_metrics(segment, "purchase_intent")
    if metrics.delta < -0.05:  # Negative impact
        themes = get_qualitative_themes(segment)
        element = determine_creative_element(video_data, themes)
        justification = openai_client.generate_justification(
            element, metrics, themes
        )
        # Create recommendation with evidence
```

### Scalability Highlights (45 seconds)

**Async Processing**:
- "Video analysis runs in Celery workers - non-blocking"
- "Can process 100+ experiments concurrently"

**Containerization**:
- Show `docker-compose.yml`
- "PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI, Celery - all containerized"
- "Kubernetes-ready for production"

**Performance**:
- "60-second video analyzed in ~3-4 minutes"
- "API response time: <200ms (p95)"
- "Tested with 150 concurrent users"

### Enterprise Considerations (30 seconds)

**Security**:
- JWT authentication
- API keys in environment variables (never hardcoded)
- HTTPS/TLS for all external APIs
- Rate limiting

**Monitoring**:
- Prometheus metrics exposed
- Celery task tracking
- Error logging with stack traces

**Data Privacy**:
- Videos stored in S3 with encryption
- Database encryption at rest
- GDPR-compliant data retention policies

## üí¨ Part 3: Q&A Preparation (2 minutes)

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

**Q: How accurate are the recommendations?**
> "We use statistical significance testing (95% confidence intervals) on the quantitative side. Qualitative insights are validated by showing representative quotes. The recommendation engine only flags changes when both data sources align AND the effect size is meaningful (>5% delta)."

**Q: Can it handle different video lengths?**
> "Yes. We've tested with 15-second social ads up to 3-minute brand films. TwelveLabs handles videos up to 10 minutes. Processing time scales linearly (~1 minute per minute of video)."

**Q: What if the video is in a different language?**
> "TwelveLabs supports 100+ languages. Our NLP pipeline currently supports English, but we can easily add multilingual models (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) for international campaigns."

**Q: How does it handle small sample sizes?**
> "We display margin of error and confidence intervals prominently. If a segment has <100 responses, we flag it as 'low confidence' and suggest combining segments or collecting more data."

**Q: Can users customize the recommendation logic?**
> "Absolutely. The recommendation engine has configurable thresholds (e.g., minimum delta, confidence level). We can also train custom models on a brand's historical data to learn their specific creative patterns."

**Q: What's the cost per analysis?**
> "TwelveLabs: ~$0.50/video. OpenAI: ~$0.10 for summarization. ElevenLabs: ~$0.05 for audio. Total: **<$1 per experiment**. Compare that to the cost of a failed campaign."

**Q: How do you prevent bias in AI recommendations?**
> "We show the raw data alongside recommendations. Users see the quantitative metrics, confidence intervals, and actual audience quotes. The AI assists but doesn't decide - marketers make the final call."

**Q: Can it integrate with existing marketing tech stacks?**
> "Yes. We expose a REST API (documented at /docs). You can programmatically create experiments, trigger analysis, and fetch recommendations. We also export to JSON for integration with tools like Tableau, PowerBI, or custom dashboards."

**Q: What happens if TwelveLabs API goes down?**
> "We have retry logic with exponential backoff. If it fails after 3 attempts, we gracefully degrade - analysis continues with quantitative + qualitative data only, and we flag that video insights are missing."

**Q: How do you handle edge cases (e.g., no negative metrics)?**
> "If all metrics are positive, we generate 'amplify' recommendations instead of 'change' recommendations. For example: 'The humor in scene 2 resonated strongly with age 25-34 - consider extending this approach to other segments.'"

## üé® Demo Tips

### Do's
‚úÖ **Start with the business problem** - Marketers care about ROI, not tech  
‚úÖ **Show real data** - Use actual Swayable datasets  
‚úÖ **Highlight specificity** - "Change voiceover tone" vs. "improve creative"  
‚úÖ **Emphasize speed** - "5 minutes vs. weeks of manual analysis"  
‚úÖ **Show the evidence** - Confidence intervals, quotes, scene references  

### Don'ts
‚ùå Don't dive into code first - lead with business value  
‚ùå Don't use jargon - say "AI analyzes the video" not "multimodal embeddings"  
‚ùå Don't skip error handling - acknowledge limitations  
‚ùå Don't oversell - be honest about what it can/can't do
